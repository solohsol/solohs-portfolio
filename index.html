    <h2>my bio</h2>
    <p>



I'm an aspiring web developer with a growing foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Yii2, and MySQL. My journey in web development has given me hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies, and I'm eager to build on these skills in a real-world setting.

I’m particularly passionate about creating user-friendly, dynamic web applications and am motivated to deepen my understanding of responsive design and modern frameworks. While I’m still expanding my skills, I approach each project with a strong work ethic, an eagerness to learn, and a commitment to continuous improvement. I’m excited to bring my developing skill set to a supportive, innovative team where I can gain practical experience, contribute meaningfully, and learn from industry professionals.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a motivated and curious web developer starting my career with foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Yii2, and MySQL. Driven by a passion for technology and creative problem-solving, I’m actively honing my skills to build engaging, effective digital experiences. I’ve had the chance to work on small projects that have strengthened my understanding of both front-end and back-end development, and I’m eager to deepen this experience in a professional setting.

I’m especially interested in learning from experienced developers and tackling real-world challenges as part of a collaborative team. My goal is to continuously improve my technical expertise while delivering meaningful contributions wherever I can. I'm excited to find an internship where I can add value, expand my knowledge, and bring energy and determination to each project.
